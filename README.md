I'm a part of the [PortMaster](https://portmaster.games) community, we bring PC games to retro handhelds as ports! Most of my repositories are prefixed with `PortMaster-`. I engineer my ports in these repositories before publishing them with PortMaster. Some of my ports have required extensive modifications to the source code--most  of my forks are intended for PortMaster development.

PortMaster is an application designed for linux handhelds with aarch64 architecture. Since many games aren't built for aarch64 by default, we design wrappers to help them run. We have many tools at our disposal including:

- [GPtoKeyB](https://github.com/EmuELEC/gptokeyb) (Gamepad to Keyboard emulator, which supports mouse emulation as well)
- [GMLoader](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/droidports) and [GMLoader-Next](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/gmloader-next), which translate Game Maker bytecode to linux (with some limitations)
- [Gl4es](https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es), which translates OpenGL functions and symbols to GLES (helps embedded systems)

PortMaster ports always require the end-user supply their own game data for games that are not licensed for distribution. This means games must be purchased on Steam or GOG or another supported PC platform. In other words, PortMaster supplies the ship, and end-users supply the cargo.

#

Beyond PortMaster, I also work with a bit of Python:

- [EmulationStation Tools](https://github.com/JeodC/EmulationStation-Tools) - A collection of scripts for various use cases within the emulationstation frontend.
- [EmulationStation ImageMaker](https://github.com/JeodC/EmulationStation-ImageMaker) - Takes several elements meant for a single image and combines them into one. Makes it easy to generate custom cover art.
